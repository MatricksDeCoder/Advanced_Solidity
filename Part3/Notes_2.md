## Precompiled contracts
 - useful since EVM is not efficient
 - mostly for cryptographic aspects
 - tend to have addresses in lower range e.g 0x1, 0x2, 0x9 etc
 - jump out of EVM to work in client 
 - // SHA256 implemented as a native contract. 
 - tend to take form below 
 ```
 type sha256hash struct{}
// RequiredGas returns the gas required to execute the pre-compiled
contract.
//
// This method does not require any overflow checking as the input size gas
costs
// required for anything significant is so high it's impossible to pay for.
func (c *sha256hash) RequiredGas(input []byte) uint64 {
return uint64(len(input)+31)/32*params.Sha256PerWordGas +
params.Sha256BaseGas
}
func (c *sha256hash) Run(input []byte) ([]byte, error) {
h := sha256.Sum256(input)
return h[:], nil
}
 ```
- to use precompiles you must know how to call them 
- The precompile directory in ethereumâ€™s Go client currently looks like this:
```
var PrecompiledContractsByzantium = map[common.Address]PrecompiledContract{     common.BytesToAddress([]byte{1}): &ecrecover{}, common.BytesToAddress([]byte{2}): &sha256hash{}, common.BytesToAddress([]byte{3}): &ripemd160hash{}, common.BytesToAddress([]byte{4}): &dataCopy{}, common.BytesToAddress([]byte{5}): &bigModExp{}, common.BytesToAddress([]byte{6}): &bn256Add{}, common.BytesToAddress([]byte{7}): &bn256ScalarMul{}, common.BytesToAddress([]byte{8}): &bn256Pairing{},
}
```
- e.g bigModExp resides at address 0x05
- e.g bn256Add lives at 0x06 
- bn256ScalarMul lives at 0x07, and performs k * (x, y), for k in a group with the order of the curve, and (x, y) a valid curve point as above. The inputs here are x, y, k
- calling ScalarMul below 
```
function ecmul(uint ax, uint ay, uint k) public view returns(uint[2] memory p) {
 uint[3] memory input;
 input[0] = ax;
 input[1] = ay;
 input[2] = k;

 assembly {
   if iszero(staticcall(gas, 0x07, input, 0x60, p, 0x40)) {
       revert(0,0)
   }
 }
 return p;
}
```
- pointers to memory can be initialised as let p := mload(0x40)

## Solidity User Defined Types 
- makes use of wrap and unwwrap
- https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html#user-defined-value-types 
- e.g // Represent a 18 decimal, 256 bit wide fixed point type using a user
defined value type.
   - type UFixed256x18 is uint256 

## Solidity function types 
- function(uint) external callback;
- then pass into functions as 
```
function query(bytes memory data, function(uint) external callback) public
{
requests.push(Request(data, callback));
emit NewRequest(requests.length - 1);
}
function reply(uint requestID, uint response) public {
// Here goes the check that the reply comes from a trusted source
requests[requestID].callback(response);
}
``` 

## Data location and assignment behaviour

- Data Location & Assignment: Data locations are not only relevant for persistence of data, but also for the semantics of assignments.

- Assignments between storage and memory (or from calldata) always create an independent copy.

- Assignments from memory to memory only create references. This means that changes to one memory variable are also visible in all other memory variables that refer to the same data.

- Assignments from storage to a local storage variable also only assign a reference.

- All other assignments to storage always copy. Examples for this case are assignments to state variables or to members of local variables of storage struct type, even if the local variable itself is just a reference.
