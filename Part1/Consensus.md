## How does the choice of consensus mechanism affect smart contract design ?

- scalability of blockchain impacts scalability, speed, finality of smart contracts applications
- consider fee considerations for congested network so gas optimizations in smart contract design become important
- need to develop high throughput consensus protocols 
- block times, block gas limits, time to finality are affected
- aspects like ability to do MEV affected
